# ETL-Project
# Analysis of Airline Crashes Between 1970 and 2009
The purpose of this project was to assess and evaluate the relationships of fatalities from airplane crashes from 1970-2009. The intention was that once ETL was complete we could analyse the data to show safety among airlines, number of incidents/crashes across decades, uncover the airline with the most crashes and inspect the percentage of fatalities to passengers per crash. The two sources of data that are presented are connected by one common column that is the Airline name or “Operator”. We are able to then decipher the information based upon this certain variable. There has also been an analysis to understand which airline by country has the most crashes, by filtering this information which country of origin is the most unreliable.
